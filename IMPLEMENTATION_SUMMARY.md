# Simplified Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- Created migration file: `scripts/migrations/001_remove_embedding_jobs_unique_constraint.sql`
  - Removes the UNIQUE constraint on (source_url, library_id) 
  - Adds performance indexes
- Created migration runner: `scripts/run-migration.ts`
- Added npm script: `npm run migration <filename>`

### 2. Backend Changes
- Updated `src/lib/ingestion/webScrape.ts`:
  - Added optional `existingLibraryId` parameter
  - Supports adding resources to existing libraries
  - Skips library creation if ID provided
  
- Updated `src/lib/ingestion/apiSpec.ts`:
  - Added optional `existingLibraryId` parameter
  - Appends timestamp to spec files for existing libraries
  - Supports adding specs to existing libraries

- Updated `src/lib/ingestion/index.ts`:
  - Passes `existingLibraryId` to handlers

- Updated `src/routes/libraries.ts`:
  - Added new endpoint: `POST /:libraryId/add-resource`
  - Accepts same payload as `/add-source`
  - Uses existing library instead of creating new one

### 3. Frontend Changes
- Created `frontend/src/components/AddResourceModal.tsx`:
  - Modal for adding resources to existing libraries
  - Supports both URL and API spec types
  - Navigates to job status page on success

- Updated `frontend/src/services/api.ts`:
  - Added `addLibraryResource()` function

- Updated `frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`:
  - Added "Add Resource" button in Actions column
  - Integrates AddResourceModal
  - Opens modal with library context

## How to Use

### Step 0: Database Configuration
Create a `.env` file with your database credentials:
```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database
DB_PORT=5432
```

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
# Make sure your database is running
npm run migration 001_remove_embedding_jobs_unique_constraint.sql
```

### Step 2: Start Backend
```bash
npm run dev:backend
# or
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Add Resources
1. Go to the homepage with your libraries list
2. Click "Add Resource" button next to any library
3. Choose between:
   - **Web URL**: Add a URL to crawl for documentation or code
   - **API Specification**: Paste an OpenAPI/Swagger spec
4. Fill in the required fields
5. Click "Add Resource"
6. You'll be redirected to the job status page

## What This Enables

- ✅ Add multiple URLs to the same library
- ✅ Add multiple API specs to the same library  
- ✅ Mix different resource types in one library
- ✅ Re-crawl the same URL if needed
- ✅ Keep existing functionality intact

## Limitations (Accepted for Simplicity)

- No dedicated UI to view all resources for a library
- No way to edit or delete individual resources
- Duplicate URLs can be added (no validation)
- Resources are tracked only through jobs

## Future Enhancements

When ready for full implementation:
1. Create `library_resources` table
2. Add resource management UI
3. Add validation and constraints
4. Track resource metadata

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database migration runs successfully
- [ ] Can still create new libraries with sources
- [ ] Can add URLs to existing libraries
- [ ] Can add API specs to existing libraries
- [ ] Jobs are created and processed correctly
- [ ] Frontend modal works properly
- [ ] Navigation to job status works
